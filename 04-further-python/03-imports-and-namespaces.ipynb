Without this separation, the likely result of the example above would be that `k` would be overwritten, either when the function is defined or when it is run (possibly both), whereas by using distinct namespaces, both variables can coexist peacefully. Really what we should do in the example above is use more descriptive variable names, but even then it would still be possible for a large code base to use a variable name more than once in different places, so namespaces help reduce the chance of name conflicts.\n",

This can be useful if we know that we'll be using a few things from a module many times, but not using anything else from the same module, since it allows us to skip typing `np.` in front of that variable every time we use it.
