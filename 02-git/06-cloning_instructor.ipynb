    "So far we've only dealt with git repos which exist entirely locally - you've created a repo, added commits and navigated the history, all on your local machine. These are all important skills, but a powerful aspect of version control is in keeping a remote copy of your files somewhere else. Most commonly, this somewhere else will be a specific hosting service like [GitHub](https://github.com/), but in principle it can be any external computer you have access to or even a different location on your local machine (although this is less likely to be useful).\n",

    "This allows you both to back up your files in case something happens to your local copy, and to share your code with others, so it's very important that we learn to interact with non-local versions of repositories. We'll be going into detail on a variety of ways to do this in later lessons, but for now the first thing you'll need to know about is **cloning** a repository."
