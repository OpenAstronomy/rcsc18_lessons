    "<p>As the images above demonstrate, the choice of colour map can make a significant difference to how your image appears, and is therefore extremely important. This is partly due to discrepancies between how quickly the colour map changes and how quickly the data changes, and partly due to the fact that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_%28viral_phenomenon%29\">different people see colour differently</a>.<br/><br/></p>\n",
    "<p>In particular, the <code>'jet'</code> (rainbow) colour map used as a default in many plotting packages (including matplotlib 1.x) is notoriously bad for displaying data. This is because it is not designed taking into account how the human eye percieves colour. This leads to some parts of the colour map appearing to change very slowly, while other parts of the colour map shift from one hue to another in a very short space. The practical effect of this is to both smooth some parts of the image, obscuring the data, and to create artificial features in the image where the data is smooth.<br/><br/></p>\n",
    "<p>There is no single 'best' colour map - different colour maps display different kinds of image most clearly - but the <code>'jet'</code> map is almost never an appropriate choice for displaying any data. In general, colour maps which vary luminosity uniformly (such as the <code>'gray'</code> colour map above or the <code>'cubehelix'</code> colour map) tend to be better. Plots of various colour maps' luminosities can be found <a href=\"http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html\">here</a>. If you're not sure what colour map to use, the main defaults in matplotlib 2.x are well designed and are generally safe bets. Older versions use <code>'jet'</code> as the default, so be aware of that.<br/><br/></p>\n",
