    "This works in this example because I've used a file containing only our first versions of the tests, which took no input. Using the new combined test, `pytest` doesn't know what input to provide, so it reports the test as having failed. However, there is a commonly-used feature in `pytest` which addresses this, which is the `parametrize` decorator. This allows you to specify inputs for the input parameters of your test functions. What makes it particularly useful though, is that you can specify several for each parameter and `pytest` will automatically run the test with all of those inputs. In this way you can automate testing your functions with a wide range of inputs without having to type out many different function calls yourself.\n",
