This is great for sharing or publishing work, but this session is supposed to be about collaborating with others, which will often mean making changes to an existing project started by someone else. So now we need to look at the workflow for getting work from other people, editing it, and then making those changes available to them.\n",

We also talked about cloning and briefly about pulling in previous sessions, both of which are ways to copy from a repo in a remote location onto our local machine. So to collaborate with someone on an existing repo, we need to **clone** that repo, make whatever changes we want to using `git add` and `git commit`, then **push** those changes somewhere.\n",

    "You should find that this hasn't worked. This is because the version of the repo on GitHub belongs to me, and you don't have permissions to write to it. This is an important aspect of working collaboratively because it means I can trust that nobody can change my copy of my code unless I give them permission. I could give all of you permissions to access my repo and have you all push there, but I'm not going to. One reason is because the changes you have made would conflict with everyone else's, so the push still wouldn't work anyway (again, more on dealing with this in a later session).
