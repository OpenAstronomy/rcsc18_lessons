At the moment, the user is yourself, and you've only just written the function, so it doesn't take a lot to remember what the function does and what parameters it takes.\n",

You might have some task you want to do many times over several projects over the next few years, in which case the user may be future-you. Will you remember in two weeks' time what parameters your function takes? How about in two months? Two years? If you make your code available to others to use, they will also want to know how to use your functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of figuring out how to use a function is to simply look at the code, but this isn't ideal. It means finding the particular file where the function is written and looking through the whole function to see what all the variables do, which is time-consuming and can be difficult in large or complex functions. A much better solution is documentation - writing down what your code does as you write it.\n",

    "Some large software packages may have a manual, or narrative documentation which describes conceptually how and why to use different parts of that software. These are useful and an important aspect of documentation.

To do this we'll use two things: comments, which we've already seen, and **docstrings**.\n",

Also, what if the comment isn't wrong? Maybe we changed the comment and then neglected to change the code.

This is useful not only for sharing code with others, but also for the original programmer.
